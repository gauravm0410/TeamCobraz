            <p>"Expense Explorer" is a user-friendly platform designed to help individuals track and manage their daily expenses effectively. The website allows users to input their daily expenditures, categorizing them into various sections like groceries, transportation, dining, and more. Once the data is entered, the platform offers personalized financial advice, pinpointing areas where users can cut down on unnecessary spending or adopt smarter spending habits.</p><br><p>
                In addition to offering saving tips, Expense Explorer continuously monitors the user’s daily expenditure, helping them stay on track with their financial goals. The website sets a customized daily budget limit based on the user’s preferences and alerts them when they are approaching or exceeding that limit. By analyzing spending patterns, the platform ensures that users are not only informed of their financial behavior but also empowered to make better financial decisions.</p>
                <br><p>This project is designed to support long-term financial well-being by encouraging mindful spending, promoting saving strategies, and preventing overspending through timely notifications and advice.</p>
